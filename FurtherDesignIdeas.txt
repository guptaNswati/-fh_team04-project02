Further Design ideas

1)  Create Game class that can have pluggable Players
   a) create a Player for a shared GUI
   b) create a Player for individual Kamisado boards
   c) create a BOT player ( note:  can be set to have BOT vs BOT )
   d) integrate with web version so we can have a java GUI for one player and
      a HTML5/Javascript GUI for the other player.
      
2)  Integrate additions as above with the splash page ( to create and set 
    the pluggable Players depending on the users settings ).
