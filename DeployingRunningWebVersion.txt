Options for seeing a working version of our web version of Kamisado:

  1) Deploy into a compliant JEE 7 app server ( like glassfish or tomcat )*
  2) Use webapp-runner.jar and the KamisadoClient.war file ( ** )
  3) Access the deployed version on a hosted service ( like heroku ) **
  
  *)  Have created a versoin that runs on tomcat ( 8.0.35 ).  Place Kamisado.war into the webapps folder and startup tomcat.
      Point 2 browsers to http://localhost:8080/Kamisado/KAMISADO.html.  In each browser you will see a text field that tell the user
      their player color.  Whie moves first so initially click on a white piece to indicate the piece you are interested in moving.  Then
      click on one of the allowable move squares ( show by a dot in the center of the sqaure ). Both players will see the updated board
      with the just moved piece.  Thne on the Black player's board,  the alloable moves will be show.  Then,  the other player's
      allowable moves will be shown and the play chooses the move he/she can make.

  **) I'm working on getting the web implementation up and running with webapp-runner.  Have a running version in glassfish ( deployed using NetBeans IDE and a version for tomcat as well ).
