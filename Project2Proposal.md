## 1.0	Project Overview
### 1.1 Abstract

The purpose of this project is to develop a Java implementation of the board game Kamisado. Kamisado is a two-player game that was released in 2008, and it takes about ten minutes to play. One player controls eight black pieces, and the other player controls eight white pieces. The board is an 8x8 area comprised of colored squares. Each of the players' eight pieces is marked with a different color corresponding to the colors on the board. Each piece can move forward or diagonally-forward as many spaces as possible without crossing through occupied spaces, but the player doesn't get to choose which piece he moves – the piece he must move is the piece whose color matches that of the space that his opponent landed on last turn. The first player to move one of his pieces to the opposite end of the board wins the game. 

The software will be written in Java, using Swing for the GUI. Java2D may be used for graphics, but it may be easier to design the graphics in an external program like Photoshop or GIMP and use them in Swing.

The game will be playable by two players locally on one machine. The user will start up the program, start a two player game, and play along with a friend. Each player will take turns using the mouse to move their pieces. The spaces available for them to move their piece to will be highlighted, and if the user hovers over an available space, the opponent's piece that will move on the next turn will be highlighted. The game will automatically end when the win condition for one player is met, and the game can be reset at any time.

Additionally, the teams aims to include a computer player so that one player may still play the game. Due to the simple rules and the fact that only one piece is able to move each turn, a simple AI player should not be difficult to implement.


### 1.2.	Target Customer [important part]

The client for this project would be a PC game distribution service like Steam, EA Origin, or Uplay. The client would sell the game over their distribution service and take a percentage of the profits. 

The users of this software are the people who want to play Kamisado either with a friend or against a computer opponent. They would buy the game from the distributor and play it on their computers.

###1.4.	Scope and Objectives [critical section]
[What is the scope and goals of your group project?]

[The scope describes the specific software system that your team will be designing and delivering.]

[Reminder:

*	The ideal project will be a software system that will challenge a team of 4 or 5 students to use a broad range of software engineering skills. This includes skills, such as, requirements analysis, software design and architecture,  implementation, testing, to project planning, scheduling, tracking and documentaiton.

*	Each student will each work approximately 10 hours per week for 4 weeks<sup>[1](#footnote_1)</sup>.  As part of the team experience, you will be analyzing what the client would be asking from the developers, list the services and features  to be provided by the proposed system, estimate the efforts for each service or feature, identify the components that have priority and negotiate project services based on time (and budget constraints).<br>
 *<sup><a name="footnote_1">1</a></sup>Note: Rarely does a proposal come in over the top. Instead, more often a proposal is not sufficient in scope and hence not accepted (until modified).*

*	 For every component, state whether you will be working on the implementation<sup>[2](#footnote_2)</sup> that  will support it, or whether you will use existing work. <br>
 *<sup><a name="footnote_2">2</a></sup>Note: The impelementation involves source code.*]

## 2.0	Team and Constraints

###2.1.	Team profile
[What are the strengths for each team member?]

[For each member of the team ***describe qualifications and strengths***<sup>[3](#footnote_3)</sup>.

*<sup><a name="footnote_3">3</a></sup>Note: Every team member is expected to be involved in all project activities. This section only describes individual strengths, and NOT the team member’s sole responsibilites.*]


### 2.1.	Challenges
[What are the challenges you foresee in successfully completing your project?]

[Provide a ***description of challenges*** that your group might face. These are often technical and non-technical aspects that may not be apparent to the reader.]

For example, if you were creating a software system for a dental office to manage patients, a challenge may be learning the domain, which involves following HIPPA regulations in disclosure of protected health information.

### 2.2.	Assumptions and Constraints
[Under what assumptions and constraints will the team adhere to?]

[**List any specific assumptions on which the project is based on and imposed constraints** that your team will be working under. Non-technical constraints could be: such as schedule and budget. Technical constraints may be design or implementation metholodogies, tools, operating system(s), hardware or software constraints.

##3.0	Deliverables and Milestones

### 3.1.	Project Deliverables 

[What are the specific delivarables by your team?]

[***Provide a list of deliverables***<sup>[4](#footnote_4)</sup> of any project artifacts.]

Deliverables include:
*	Software System Project Proposal.
*	[design document]
*	[user manual and installation instructions]
*	[presentations]
*	[any other documents]
*	[implementation code]
*	[This list may include product deployment activities that are necessary for the successful use of the system your team develops.]

 *<sup><a name="footnote_4">4</a></sup>Note: This list may be modified over the weeks until the final submission.* 



### 3.2.	Schedule and Budget Summary [critical section]
[What are the projected milestones and specific delivarables?]

[Fill in your teams projected milestones. You will be modifying this over the next few weeks.]
